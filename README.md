# Run the Project

- Download Images from Kaggle Dataset, store originals on ```datasets/raw_images```
- File ```notebooks/code.ipynb``` does image processing and model training


# Project Objective and Purpose
We want to explore possibilities in identifying PPEs on images, using:

Deep Learning Models: PPE systems need object detection models such as You Only Look Once (YOLO) or Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster-RCNN) to recognize PPE gear.
Image Processing Techniques: The techniques include pipelines that process raw data for use by detection models. Data processing steps may include transformation, normalization, and augmentation.
Integration with AI and Machine Learning Frameworks: An efficient detection system requires integrating CV models with machine learning platforms such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV
We expect to use neural networks applied to computer vision in order to identify the use of PPE on multiple instances of work related scenes, allowing the observer to decide whether the situation brings risk to the employee or not.

## Introduction
Construction practitioners are at a disproportionately higher risk of fatal and nonfatal injuries compared to practitioners from other industries. The absence of and inappropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), hereinafter referred to as PPE non-compliance, are major causes of fatal and nonfatal injuries at construction workplaces (Jalil Al-Bayati et al., 2023)
One strategy to mitigate these incidents is implementing a strict policy of wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) when working in hazardous environments. This equipment can include protective glasses, high-visibility vests, gloves, and helmets to ensure the workers remain safe and productive in the long run.

However, manually monitoring PPE compliance is challenging as it involves the daily supervision of an extensive workforce. Traditional safety inspections rely heavily on human intervention, which is prone to error and delays (Kursunoglu et al., 2022).

An alternative is using the latest computer vision (CV)-based solutions and frameworks to determine whether workers wear PPE according to safety protocols. By integrating computer vision PPE detection technology, industries can automate and enhance the compliance monitoring process. (Vukicevic et al., 2024).

PPE detection using computer vision algorithms and machine learning models will scan for any missing or incomplete pieces of protective gear, such as hard hats, safety glasses, high-visibility vests, and other protective equipment. With real-time PPE compliance monitoring, companies can improve safety outcomes by identifying violations the moment they occur. This equips the EHS teams to rely on the use of computer vision for PPE compliance and send automated alerts to prevent any workplace accident.
